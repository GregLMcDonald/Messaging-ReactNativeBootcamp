A messaging app built as part of my React Native bootcamp using the book **Fullstack React Native: The Complete Guide to React Native**.  This project is described in the *Core APIs* chapter and introduces the NetInfo, Dimensions, CameraRoll, and PixelRatio APIs.  It also uses navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition() and MapView to create and display location messages.  A Grid component is built based on FlatList to display selectable images from the CameraRoll in a grid.  New text messages are entered in a TextInput component where again the parent of the TextInput keeps an up-to-date version of the value of the TextInput and passes it up to its parent when the new text has been submitted.
